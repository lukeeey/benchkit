# Benchkit Server Plugin
This is the plugin that should be installed on a Minecraft server.

Currently supported platforms are:
* Nukkit
* Cloudburst

...with plans to support Spigot (with Geyser) as well!

### Contributing
The bulk of the code is in the `core` module. Platform specific implementations should reside
in their respective modules.
